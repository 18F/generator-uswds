# Images

This is where your site's images live. You're free to put them wherever you
want, of course; but we suggest that you place any site-specific images in this
directory (and organize them into sub-directories as needed), and leave the
images in [vendor/uswds](vendor/uswds) alone unless you need to customize them.
