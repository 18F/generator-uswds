# Fonts

This is where the USWDS custom font files live. You can put whatever you want
in here, but for the sake of upgrading to a future version of USWDS, we suggest
that you leave the fonts in [vendor/uswds](uswds/vendor) alone.

If you wish to use different fonts (be they system fonts or other custom fonts
that you've downloaded), you should customize the [USWDS SCSS
variables](../sass/vendor/uswds/core/_variables.scss) accordingly.
